## What is this?

This is a simple chess "vision" game to help memorize chess
coordinates. 

When you click the correct square, a new coordinate is shown.

UI still needs work, but it's usable at least!

## Development

The following will build the code, watch for changes (and
automatically recompile) and start a server on port 8080. After
running this command, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080

	npx shadow-cljs watch frontend
	
If you want a repl:

	npx shadow-cljs browser-repl
